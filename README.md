# SeaTalk-Tiller-Remote
 
Seatalk-Tiller-Remote is an Arduino project that intefaces with a Raymarine/Raytheon tiller pilot using a 433mhz remote and RCswitch library to add a remote contol to your tiller pilot.
It also accepts NMEA sentances for Boat Speed and Wind Data and sends over Seatalk to all you to use WindTrim mode.

It was build on an Arduino Nano with an rxb8 433mhx remote and 4 button waterproof remote.

You need a 4 button remote.

A = Port 10Degress<br>
B = Starboard 10Degrees<br>
C = Port 1 Degree<br>
D = Starboard 1 Degree<br>
A+B = Auto Mode<br>
C+D = Standby Mode<br>
A+C = Tack Port<br>
B+D = Tack Starboard<br>
A+D = Wind Trim Mode<br>
C+B = Wind Trim Mode<br>
